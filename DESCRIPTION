Description: This package implements a number of methods for comparing means between two sets of data when the samples are
aartially paired, but there is data in both sets that is not paired.  The methods are described in detail in Guo and Yuan (2015).  The tests
implemented include pooled t-test and weighted t-test from Samawi and Vogel (2014), optimal pooled t-test devised by Guo and Yuan, corrected z-test
from Looney and Jones (2003), and modified maximum likelihood estimator from Lin and Stivers (1974).
